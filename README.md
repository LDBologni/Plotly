## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of the projext is to complete the dashboard Roza has been working on so far, in order to visualize the bacterial data obtained from each volunteer to Improbably Beef. The dashboard consists on a dropdown list menu to view different subjects along with different charts, as for example a bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart, in order to see the data associated with each subject in different ways. With the dashboard the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons, as well for if Improbable Beef to identify the species and a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef.

## Summary

With this dashboard Roza will be able to let her partners at Improbable Beef about all the findings on their own terms and hopefully gain some great insights to manufacture sunthetic beef.
